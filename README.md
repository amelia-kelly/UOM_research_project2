Modelling oxygen uptake by Streptomyces coelicolor cultivated in liquid medium by dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA) coupled with ensemble modelling.


Understanding the switch to secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor is key to the production of many clinically relevant secondary metabolites. To aid the reproducibility of batch cultures used to produce such compounds in sillico modelling, such as Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA), can be adopted to predict the optimum culturing conditions for certain micro-organisms. However, due to a lack of experimentally determined values for oxygen exchange, oxygen flux is often left unconstrained reducing the overall accuracy of the metabolic models. Using an emerging software to compute microbial ecosystems in time and space (COMETS) I devised a novel model using a genome-scale metabolic model in dFBA with an ensemble modelling approach.


Here are the code to run dFBA coupled with ensemble modelling and sensitivity analysis. Some functions created for the project are also availible.
